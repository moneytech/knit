Currently this is a work in progress, it's nowhere near completion

The directory structure assumes there is a copy of hasht
get it from github.com/nilput/hasht
it's supposed to look like:
    knit->
        hasht/
            src
            scripts
            ...
        test.c
        Makefile
        ...
