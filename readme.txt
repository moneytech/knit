TODO:
    Write a lexer
    Write a parser
    Turn parser output into executable statements
    write an eval function to eval expressions
    write tests

the directory structure assumes there is a copy of hasht
get it from github.com/nilput/hasht
it's supposed to look like:
    knit->
        hasht/
            src
            scripts
            ...
        test.c
